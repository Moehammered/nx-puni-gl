# nx-puni-gl

A framework based off my rendering framework for PC. It tries to mimic Unity code style to help beginners to c++.

It includes helper components and classes to make the process of using OpenGL easier, while being as barebones as it can to let the user extend or use their own GL calls/routines.

* Transform, Camera, Mesh, and Shader classes
* Input, Timer, and GL initialisation helpers
* Text file loader

The project will expand mostly into a rendering framework with some helper tools. Also it will incorporate the Entity Component Architecture style of Unity based from my PC version of this project.

(Uses TinyObjLoader to load OBJ files. Glad, GLM, and GLFW for OpenGL. stb_image for loading image files to be used as OpenGL textures.)

## Extra unnecessary background info

The name puni comes from my initial naming scheme of "PseudoUnity" but that is too long and annoying.
So, the P in the name stands for pseudo, and uni stands for "Unity".
Put together it is pronounced as "pew-knee" and I found it amusing... :P
